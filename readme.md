# PythonList

PythonList is a concise library that wrote in pure C language in order to replicate literally the list data structure in the
Python programming language. This library targeting those who are familiar with Python syntax
and want to experience the same type of data structure in Python while coding C.



## Acknowledgements

    Since the syntax of the replicated list aren't perfectly identical to the Python language,
    there isn't any prerequisites to use the library. However, it's encouraged to have the basic
    knowledge of general C concepts inorder to expand this library:

 - [What are pointer](https://www.javatpoint.com/c-pointers#:~:text=The%20pointer%20in%20C%20language,a%20pointer%20is%202%20byte.)
 - [Python List Data Structure](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)
```
    Syntax of the library will be clarified in the API Reference
